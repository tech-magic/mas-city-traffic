# Simulating City Road Traffic with Multi-Agent Systems.

## About the Project

This project uses the concept of Multi-Agent Systems to simulate the dynamics of road traffic in a city.

Infact a similar kind of an implementation can used to dynamically vary the switching times of traffic lights in a junction based on the variation of road traffic congestion with time.
